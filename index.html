    <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Joshua Cowan! Although the website is average, I am not. After a career in food service, and running my own food truck/catering business for 6 years, I am doing a career change. I am an aspiring coder, learning all the necessary and helpful skills through an online coding bootcmp with Thinkful. I live in Grass Valley, CA with my wife and 2 year old son.

    <article id="About-Me">
      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Other than learning to code I also like to number my hobbies in numeric order based on their importance:</p> 
          <ol>
          <li> spend time with my family,</li>
          <li> make stuff, such as carving kitchen utensils and making chef knives,</li>
          <li> do research and development for my new soft drink marketed to programmers, Coda Cola!</li> 
          </ol>
        
        <p> I would like to take my experience in managment and food service to pair that with my experience in coding. I feel this brings a unique blend of skills that I can use to advance my career in web development, particularly in the arena of food service. The food service, specifically food truck, industry is growing and expanding quickly. I see a lot of potential for food trucks to expand their business, through the use of web development. This endeavor takes someone with experience in both fields, and I would enjoy working with others to bring this to fruition.
